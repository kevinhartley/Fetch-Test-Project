# Fetch-Test-Project

This project allows the user to fetch all meals from a desert category from themealdb.com and displays the results alphabetically.
It is built around async await and uses @MainActors in the viewmodels to handle thread management.
Though not part of the requirements, I implemented the ability to search for items even if they are not part of the deserts category.
You are able to see the details of items you search for and see their food category, ingredients, instructions, region of food, as well as an optional video of the food item you'd like to make.
